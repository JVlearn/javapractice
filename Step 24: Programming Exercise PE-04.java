/*


1. Create four integer variables a , b , c and d . Write an if statement to print if the sum of a and b is
greater than the sum of c and d .

jshell> if ( a +b < c+d)
   ...> System.out.println("Sum of a and b is greater than c and d");
Sum of a and b is greater than c and d

2. Store three numerical values as proposed angles of a triangle in integer variables angle1 , angle2 and
angle3 . Create an if statement to state whether these three angles together can form a triangle.

Hint: A triangle is a closed geometric figure with three angles, whose sum must exactly equal 180 degrees .

jshell> int angleOne = 55
angleOne ==> 55
jshell> int angleTwo = 65
angleOne ==> 55
jshell> int angleThree = 60
angleOne ==> 55
jshell> if (angleOne + angleTwo + angleThree == 180)
...> System.out.println("The three angles together form a triangle");
The three angles together form a triangle
jshell> angleThree = 75
angleOne ==> 55
jshell> if (angleOne + angleTwo + angleThree == 180)
...> System.out.println("The three angles together form a triangle");


3. Have a variable store an integer. Create an if statement to find out if it's an even number.
Hint: Use operator % .

jshell> int number1 = 10;
number1 ==> 10

jshell> if ( number1 % 2 == 0)
   ...> System.out.println("The stored value is even");
The stored value is even
